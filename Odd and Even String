/*
Task
Given a string, S, of length N that is indexed from 0 to N-1, print its even-indexed and odd-indexed characters as 2 space-separated strings on a single line (see the Sample below for more detail).

Note: 0 is considered to be an even index.

Example:
s = abcdef
Print abc def

Input Format:
The first line contains an integer, T (the number of test cases).
Each line i of the T subsequent lines contain a string, S.

Constraints:
  1 <= T <= 10
  2 <= length of S <= 10000

Output Format:
For each String Sj (where 0 <= j <= T-1), print Sj's even-indexed characters, followed by a space, followed by Sj's odd-indexed characters.

Sample Input:
2
Hacker
Rank

Sample Output:
Hce akr
Rn ak

Explanation:
Test Case 0: S = "Hacker"
S[0] = "H"
S[1] = "a"
S[2] = "c"
S[3] = "k"
S[4] = "e"
S[5] = "r"
The even indices are 0, 2, and 4, and the odd indices are 1, 3, 5and . We then print a single line of 2 space-separated strings;
the first string contains the ordered characters from S's even indices (Hce), and the second string contains the ordered characters from S's odd indices (akr).

Test Case 1: S = "Rank"
S[0] = "R"
S[1] = "a"
S[2] = "n"
S[3] = "k"
The even indices are 0 and 2, and the odd indices are 1 and 3. We then print a single line of 2 space-separated strings;
the first string contains the ordered characters from S's even indices (Rn), and the second string contains the ordered characters from S's odd indices (ak).
